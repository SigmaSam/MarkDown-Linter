# Markdown Linter.

This is a linter build with Ruby to find errors in documents intended to be written with Markdown format.

The linter is design to check for inconsistencies in the opening and closing symbols used in the MarkDown syntax.

It will iterate for all the lines in a document passed and check the proper position of the elements that need opening and closure, in this syntax (bold, italics, links, and placeholder text containers).
